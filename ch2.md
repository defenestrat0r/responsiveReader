“Better make it a good one, then.” He spoke with far more bravery than he felt, even going so far as to wink at her before disengaging and leaping backwards to create some space between them. Now with a bit of breathing room, Chris brought his free hand down to grip his sword with both hands, shifting his stance to better accommodate the two-handed hold. Sliding one foot back, he lifted the sword high to come level with his head, twisting it at a slight angle with the tip pointing right at his opponent’s throat. Chris’s eyes reflected the crimson that glinted off of his blade as he focused on his opponent. 

“You move swiftly, traveler.” The compliment seemed genuine, but the downright evil smile she possessed said otherwise. Chris made the mistake of blinking as a speck of dust flew into his eye. When he opened his eyes in the next second, she had disappeared. 

The shock of losing track of his opponent came first. The pain of impact followed promptly, as Chris noticed the end of the staff that had buried itself in his abdomen. She’d crossed the gap he’d created between them in the blink of an eye.

Standing on her toes to reach up to his ear, the Fae whispered, “Not swift enough, I’m afraid~” 

Her smile grew wider as the swordsman coughed up blood.

Now recovering from the initial shock, Chris swung his sword in a downwards arc towards the woman who’d made the mistake of getting up this close to him. The swing ended in a clang as steel met rock. She was no longer there.

Gritting his teeth, he pulled his sword up and stepped into another ready stance, this time with the blade being held near his hips with the tip pointed downwards. While this type of stance left him open to a lot more attacks, it also enabled for quick counters and responses. Judging by the speed of his opponent, he deemed this a much more suitable approach than his earlier stance. 

Once in guard, his eyes swept the perimeter to try and find his opponent once more. Seeing the opponent coming would greatly aid in the fight. Unfortunately, it seemed that she had no intention of giving him that advantage.

“Did you really believe that an effective weapon was all it would take to defeat me?” Her voice radiated all around him. She was everywhere, but at the same time, nowhere. 

A gust of wind billowing behind him caused Chris to spin around to face it in anticipation. Nothing awaited him in that direction.

“I had such high hopes… It’s really too bad how you turned out to be all talk.” This time, he was sure the voice was coming from near the waterfall. He made no attempt to show that he knew of her location, however, and instead slowly edged towards it, still facing the direction where the wind had startled him.

“You’re nothing but a disappointment.” Too late, Chris realized that it was a ruse. The staff came for his face, this time from the direction opposite to where he thought she was. If not for his speed in reaction, he was sure that hit would have knocked him out. As it came for him, he’d brought his sword up to parry it, but the force of the staff brought the blunt end of his own sword smashing into his face. While it didn’t cut him, it did knock one of his teeth loose.

Chris did not stop to mull over his mistake. Blocking out the pain, he pushed the staff out the way using his sword and continued the motion to deftly swing at the Fae’s legs.

Once again, a metallic clang rang out as she managed to slip through his attack.

The sound of his infuriated growl was drowned out by her ubiquitous laugh. As before, it was resonating from all around him, making him unable to pinpoint her location. She was mocking him now.

“What seems to be the matter, traveler? Where did all that bravado from earlier go?”

Maintaining his silence, he raised his sword once again from the ground. With his eyes darting around the area, Chris shuffled towards the opposite edge of the circle, swiveling every few seconds to make sure he was not caught off-guard. The stance remained the same, having served him well in the previous encounter. It had allowed him to counter fast enough to stop her attack from hitting with full force. No other stance would let him move as quick. 

Turning on his feet to face away from his target destination, so that he could see if he was being followed, he continued backing up to the edge of their arena. However, as he neared the spot, he hit something solid that halted his backwards movement. There was a silky hardness behind the velvety leaves that caressed his back, but it felt too soft to be a tree trunk. 

“Trying to run away, brave one?”

Chris had backed right into his opponent. He was sure she wasn’t there before he’d turned his back to that area, but there was no denying the voice that whispered in his ear from behind him. She did not give him time to react before her staff horizontally acquainted itself with his neck. There was light pressure on his throat, slowly increasing as she pulled him closer to her.

“Tsk, Tsk. I expected you to last longer~”

She may have appeared lithe, but her figure betrayed nothing of the monstrous strength that he was now struggling to escape. Every breath grew laborious, and his vision began to blur as she held him with an ever-tightening hold. His sword-hand moved of its own accord, but instead of trying to strike the one choking him from behind, it swung the crimson blade down at the stone floor, creating another audible clang.

“Growing delirious? I’m behind you, you fool.” An amused chuckle rang out from behind him. 

Chris’s chuckle joined hers.

The staff chafed his throat as it pulled back tighter, the Fae hissing in his ear as she heard him laugh. “What are you laughing about?”

Speech was difficult when in a chokehold, but he persevered. “Just– an old joke– I remembered.”

His thumb reached down to the sword’s cross-guard, the middle of which held a ruby, and pushed it. It reacted by immediately glowing bright crimson, casting long shadows behind them as the light spread out from the stone. 

Twin streaks of crimson light snaked out from the edges of the circle they were fighting in, meeting at the center of their arena. Their origin points glowed brighter than the streaks in the ground, shooting light into the night sky like a beacon. The places where Chris’s blade had sliced at the ground were the origin points of the streaks, now the source of a trio of beacons that raced into the air. The scarlet beacons on either side bent towards the straight one at the centre, curving through the air until all three met at a point and created an arch above them. In a brilliant explosion of red, the light spilled out like a translucent curtain, forming a dome around the circle they’d been fighting in. 

Chris felt the staff relax slightly as the Fae observed the changes in their environment, distracted by the light show that he’d summoned. He wasn’t one to waste opportunities. He let go of his weapon, allowing it to slump to the ground as he planted his feet and reached backwards to lay hands on his captor. With a firm hold on her, he swung forward with all his might, attempting to hurl the Fae away from him.

The previously untouchable opponent was startled as she was caught and thrown through the air. Rolling to a stop, she quickly spun her staff around in a defensive stance before glaring in Chris’s direction. 

“What did you do?!”

The traveler spat out the dislodged tooth as he bent down to pick his weapon up from where he’d dropped it. Twirling it once, he slid one foot forward and held one back. Returning to a two-handed hold, the sword was brought next to his hip once more, angled upwards this time. His gaze focused on his opponent once again.

Her radiance had dimmed considerably, and the antler crown she wore had diminished in size and grandeur. He flashed her a grin with his bloody mouth, his teeth now missing a unit. His trick had worked.

“I evened the odds.”

The Fae scowled at his smug expression. She knew what he’d done as soon as he was able to hold her long enough to throw her.

“Maybe now you’ll give me a fair fight~” As he stared her down once more, Chris noticed that his heart had stopped beating rapidly. Inhaling deeply, he realized he was calm. For the first time since he’d set eyes on her, he wasn’t afraid.

For the first time since the fight began… he had a chance.
