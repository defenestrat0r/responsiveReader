      <p>
        The red dome that encircled the two combatants vibrated with a magical energy, soft humming emanating from the light that it was composed of. Crimson moonlight filtered through as their celestial spectator watched on from the heavens. The waterfall was the only entity that disturbed the tense silence that had settled around the ruins, as the very air held its breath in anticipation.
      </p><p>
        The Fae’s expression held murderous intent as she kept her gaze trained on the man that had stripped her of her abilities. Her gaze was met by his, although his expression was significantly different. A smug, bloody grin adorned his face. He was enjoying this turn in the tide of battle. It was, after all, in his favor.  
      </p><p>
        “I made you a promise, traveler. I fully intend to keep it.” Growling in an almost feral manner, she rushed forward to begin her assault.
      </p><p>
      Chris stood his ground as his grip tightened around the hilt of his sword. Gone was the inhuman speed and movement, but that did not mean he was going to let his guard down. She was still an opponent, and he’d give her the same level of respect he’d give any of his opponents.
      </p><p>
      "You know what they say about promises…"
      </p><p>
      Her first blow was quite straightforward, and one he saw coming. He was quick with the counter, parrying the downward strike in an upwards arc and then using the momentum to swivel his sword towards her head. She was no slacker, he soon found, as his attack was deftly thrust away with a swift rotation of her staff.
      </p><p>
      Shuffling back, he created some distance between them so as to get a moment to recollect, but she was relentless. Closing the gap, the Fae assailed him with a flurry of expertly aimed blows. But without her powers buffing her speed, the attacks fell to the wayside as he managed to parry and duck out of the way of them all. 
      </p><p>
      They matched blow for blow, sparks erupting with every meeting of blade and staff. Despite the cold of the night, both Chris and the Fae felt hot and heavy, the effort of combat soon taking its toll on them. His tunic was stained with blood, wine and sweat, and her body glistened as the red moonlight bounced off of the sweat that dripped down her form. Breathing heavily, they crossed weapons for what looked to be the last time that night, and stood locked in position.
      </p><p>
      “Before I end you… I wish to know your name. So that I may remember the wanderer that pushed me so far.” Still panting, a smile bloomed on her face.
      </p><p>
      Returning the exhausted smile, Chris replied, “Only if you tell me yours first.” 
      </p><p>
      “I’ve not used it in so long, I fear I’ve forgotten it. Perhaps when I am at death’s door, and my life flashes by, I shall remember~” She winked suggestively.
      </p><p>
      At that, Chris chuckled. “So be it.”
      </p><p>
      With a quickness that was unexpected from one as tired as he seemed, the swordsman used his leg to sweep her feet out from under her. Distracted and lacking energy, she fell, losing her weapon in the process.
      </p><p>
      As her staff clattered to the ground and her body hit the floor, she closed her eyes and an expression of relief washed over her face. Chris leveled his sword at her throat, observing the serene smile she possessed as she took in large gulps of air. 
      </p><p>
      An image of times that had long passed rose from the depths of the triumphant traveler’s mind, with the roles reversed and his elder sister standing over him with a wooden sword in quite the same fashion as he stood now. The smile that the Fae had was quite nostalgic. The memories stung, much like the tear that mixed with the sweat and blood on his face.
      </p><p>
      “You remind me of my brother, traveler.”
      </p><p>
      Her black eyes opened to face him, her entire posture now relaxed and resigned. She’d accepted her loss, and the consequences that it entailed. 
      </p><p>
      “My name… It was Nikam.” 
      </p><p>
      “And I am Chris.” 
      </p><p>
      “Chris… Such a dull name. I shall cherish it, nonetheless. Thank you, Chris.”
      </p><p>
      “You shall be remembered, Nikam.” He gulped down his reservations and took a deep breath. This was the part he dreaded. But it had to be done.
      </p><p>
      The blade cut through his sister’s flesh with little resistance, lopping off her head with ease. She would suffer no more, and the skilled beheading meant that she would feel no pain. It had to be done.
      </p><p>
      As the dome of crimson flickered and faded, the sky grew dark and clouds blocked out the red glare of the moon. The heavens rumbled and burst, showering the earth with the gift of water. The rain washed away the blood. The rain washed away the sweat. The rain washed away the tears.
      </p><p>
      It had to be done.
      </p>
