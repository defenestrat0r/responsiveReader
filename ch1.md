Hypnotic were the sonorous melodies that wafted through the air, sweetly caressing every ear and mind that it brushed past. It felt delicate and fragile, as if it were on the verge of fracture; almost saccharine to the ear, like the crescendo of a wind-chime in reverberation. The ballad weaved itself through the catacombs, echoing aimlessly off the walls worn with age. The song dipped and rose, filling the crevices of the underground with haunting tones. It was in no mortal tongue, but it mattered not to those listening. To the casual audience it was riveting, enrapturing. To the casual audience, it was the last thing they ever heard.

*‘The only audience here besides myself are corpses, and their souls.’*

The thought was depressing. But such was the nature of truth, as was the true meaning of the song that clung to the very essence of the many souls that had wandered into this wretched space. The corpses of those that had come before him were wrapped in vines, their nutrients and essences being returned to the earth that had borne them. They were fools, unwary of the horrors that lay beyond the moss-ridden walls of this lair beneath the dirt. Chris, however, knew precisely what he had gotten into.

It was not difficult to track the song to its source. The melody beckoned him towards it. It wanted him to find it. His ears led him to a doorway draped in vines that opened out to the bottom of a spiraling stairwell. The stairs, worn and cracked with age, had the signs of abandonment and nature’s reclaim all over it. Roots broke through the tiles, moss and vines grew over the curved walls; but the stairs remained firm enough to trudge up. 

A morbid chuckle escaped his lips as he surveyed his surroundings after emerging from the stairwell, finding himself atop the waterfall he had spied in the distance earlier. After all the effort he had gone through coming underground, it was ironic that his quest was coming to an end.  Still, it was not as if the long and arduous journey had been for nought. The view was to die for.

Around him were the ruins of what was perhaps a watchtower or a minor castle. A wide, circular, stone-tiled yard was what he was currently at the very center of, with broken parts of what looked like battlements littered at the edges of the circle. Grass poked out from between the stone tiles, and the light green of moss glittered over the stones under the glow of the full moon above. 

It would’ve been much less ominous if the moon were casting its regular silver luminescence on the landscape. Instead, the silver orb in the sky leaked crimson, bathing the surroundings in scarlet. It didn’t bother the tired adventurer, though. He barely spared the blood moon a glance before continuing to inspect his surroundings. 

*‘It must’ve been a sight to behold in its prime’*, Chris mused as he extinguished the torch he’d been carrying. Out in the open air like this, under the illumination of the moon, he wasn’t going to need it. 

The excited gurgles of the waterfall nearby did nothing to drown out the bewitching melody. It seemed to have grown in vigor and volume, radiating its sound omnidirectionally as he tried to pinpoint the source. It was intoxicating now, coaxing him to give in and let it fill him. He had prepared for this. 

Reaching into his pack, Chris fished out a cask. Popping the cork that sealed it, he promptly dunked its contents into his open maw. Red liquid sloshed across his beard and dripped down his chin, staining the olive tunic beneath his iron chest-plate. Within the cask was no magical potion or alchemical brew, but the finest wine in the twelfth kingdom (that he could buy with the last of his gold). 

The effect was almost immediate. While his vision blurred, the haunting symphony was reduced to a dull throb in the back of his head. 

“I’ve rendered your tunes useless, witch. You have no– hic – hold over me.” His voice slurred as he made his loud announcement, the wine taking its toll on his speech.

“So it would seem, Traveler.”

The voice was deeper and much more pointed, but there was no mistaking the haunting undercurrent and the accent that mirrored the otherworldly tongue. This was the voice of the songstress that had led him here.

Swift as a bolt of lightning, the now-drunken traveler swiveled on his feet to face in the direction of the voice. Despite his condition, he moved with a nimbleness and speed that betrayed his lax stature. His hand had already moved to his hip, hovering over his broadsword's hilt as he steadied himself. 

The rust red of the moon complimented the chartreuse glow that emanated from every inch of the woman that had materialized a few feet behind him. Her features were difficult to make out directly, as her radiance was akin to looking directly into the flames of a torch. Squinting and letting his eyes wander instead of concentrating on a specific point, Chris managed to let his irides grow accustomed to her luminosity so that he could scope her properly.

She had a crown of antlers that extrapolated from the top of her head, shining a vibrant, dark green. Adorning her shoulders was a coat that resembled the ferns surrounding their location, bushy leaves sticking out oddly yet somehow blending in with the rest of her attire. The coat reached all the way down to her feet, spilling out onto the floor beneath. What she wore under the coat, he could not very well see, but it was form-fitting and drew attention to her toned figure. Eyes that held an empty void within them stared ahead, lifelessly. The crunch of the fresh grass under her bare feet was audible as she took a step towards him.

All of his senses screamed at him to take a simultaneous step back. Chris stood his ground.

“It is a cold and dark night for a lone man to be traveling these woods. ‘Tis not safe for mortalkind out here, I’ve heard.” She grinned. There were no teeth, just an empty void.

“Neither the dark, nor the cold has ever bothered me. They are old friends.” While they conversed, Chris was analyzing the situation. She hadn’t come into striking distance yet, but there were still all manners of things that could happen from range. He could not afford to let his guard down.

“If you continue down the path of darkness and cold, shadow and blood will be all you know~” There was playfulness in her voice as she took another step, humming along as she spoke as if singing a song. Playfulness wasn’t the only thing that Chris noticed, however. Malicious intent laced the words, dread striking his core as the melody brushed past his ear. A shiver traveled down his spine as she edged closer.

Chris stood his ground.

“Shadow and blood are all I know. But tonight, that ends. Tonight, I right the wrong that brought me to this point.” His knuckles turned white as he tightened his grip on his sword-hilt. Steely determination crept onto his face as he set his jaw, locking eyes with the woman that continued to saunter towards him. She stared right back with those soulless, empty eyes.

“All that you will have tonight is death, traveler.” 

Only the length of a broadsword separated the two now. It may seem like an odd unit of measurement, but in his experience, it was often quite useful.

“I do not fear that end, Fae.

“For what is death, but merely a lack of ale?” Cracking his own grin, Chris drew his blade and spun to his right, using the singular motion of unsheathing to carve a deadly slashing arc aimed at his opponent. Coming full circle, he halted the spinning motion and steadied himself once more, facing her with his sword held to his side in a ready stance.

Turning her head towards him, the woman’s face finally contorted to reveal emotion. It was an expression of amusement. She allowed herself a moment to laugh, her joyous chortles resonating across the still night air. It was perhaps the most pleasant thing he’d heard.

“Fool, you are! No mortal weapon can even hope to scratch me~”

Her face fell, however, as she noticed the grin still plastered on Chris’s face. A quick inspection revealed a gash across her abdomen where he’d swung, which caused a veritable storm of emotions to flit across her face. Finally settling on rage, she leveled her gaze at the traveler who she now considered a threat. For a moment, Chris thought he saw sparks of feeling in those eyes that challenged the night sky in darkness.

“Whoever said anything about a mortal weapon?” A slight wave of the blade he held made it to hum as it cut through the air. The red from the above seemed to seep into the steel of the broadsword, giving it a crimson sheen as the moonlight glanced off it. It was quite clear now that this was no regular sword.

Wiping her hand across the gash, she inspected the lavender blood that had seeped out from the wound. A crazed smile alit her face as she pointed right at her assailant.

“There is no escape for you, traveler. 

“Under this blood moon, you shall die.” Though her voice was steady, there was a torrent of giddiness beneath it. She was not threatening him anymore. It was a promise.

“Escape?” It was Chris’s turn to laugh.

“I did not come here by chance, and I do not intend to leave before ending your tyranny.” With a flamboyant twirl of his sword, he took a step forward to close the gap between them. 

“Know that this is your last dance, Fae.

“And use what little time you have left to pray.”

Snapping her left hand forward, the Fae summoned forth her own weapon : a glowing chartreuse staff that materialized in a flurry of sparks. 

“To pray implies that there must be a creature or being that is greater than  I~”

Twirling her weapon with inhuman speed, she stepped forward to cross her staff with Chris’s sword, meeting him in stride. They were now at a standstill at the very center of the circle, weapons locked and standing just a foot apart from each other. She could hear Chris’s heart beating with an ever-increasing frequency, and he could feel the coolness of her breath on his skin as they stared each other down.

“Still... if it is dance you wish, a dance I will provide.” 

There was an excitement in her voice that hadn’t been there previously.
