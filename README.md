# It's fairly basic
I'm using this to re-learn web dev!
The idea here is to display a short story I wrote in a webpage that is fairly responsive and adjusts some of its layout to better suit different screen sizes.
# Currently used
- Html
- Pure CSS
  - Flexboxes
  - Grids
  - Media Queries 
  - Transition Animations
- Pure JS
  - Change chapters when navbar buttons are pressed! (Currently just show / hide, but possible plans to make it pull from a server?)
  - Expand navbar and change its style when clicked (Toggle function)
  - Dark Mode!
  - Title page for when load instead of immediately landing on Chapter 1 (currently on a separate branch because ugly)
# Next Up
- Server stuff
  - Put chapters on a server and load dynamically from there
  - Probably have to look into AJAX and JSON formats
