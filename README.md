# It's fairly basic
I'm using this to re-learn web dev!
The idea here is to display a short story I wrote in a webpage that is fairly responsive and adjusts some of its layout to better suit different screen sizes.
# Currently used
- Html
- Pure CSS
  - Flexboxes
  - Grids
  - Media Queries 
  - Transition Animation (using Hover states as triggers)
- Pure JS
  - Change chapters when navbar buttons are pressed! (Currently just show / hide, but possible plans to make it pull from a server?)
# Next Up
- Pure JS
  - > dark mode button because yes that is a thing that I also believe is a JS thing to do
  - > Title page for when load instead of immediately landing on Chapter 1
