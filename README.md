# It's fairly basic
I'm using this to re-learn web dev!
The idea here is to display a short story I wrote in a webpage that is fairly responsive and adjusts some of its layout to better suit different screen sizes.
# Currently used
- Html
- Pure CSS
  - Flexboxes
  - Grids
  - Media Queries 
    - Different layouts for smaller screens
    - Hover for touch screen disabled
  - Transition Animations
  - Clean scrolling
- Pure JS
  - Change chapters when navbar buttons are pressed! (Currently just show / hide)
  - Expand navbar and change its style when clicked (Toggle function)
  - Dark Mode! 
    - Query user preference for theme and toggle it automatically on page load ('prefers-color-scheme')
  - Title page for when load instead of immediately landing on Chapter 1 (currently on a separate branch because ugly)
  - SPA
    - Fetches chapters as md files and parses them to text
# Next Up
- Massive white space on the right in landscape is bothering me. (I put a column there to put something there later)
