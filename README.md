# It's fairly basic
I'm using this to re-learn web dev!
The idea here is to display a short story I wrote in a webpage that is fairly responsive and adjusts some of its layout to better suit different screen sizes.
# Currently used
- Html
- Pure CSS
  - Flexboxes
  - Grids
  - Media Queries 
  - Transition Animation (using Hover states as triggers)
# Next Up
- Pure JS
  - > I need to change chapters based on what nav button the user presses, so I'm assuming that's a JS thing to do
  - > I also need to do a dark mode button because yes that is a thing that I also believe is a JS thing to do
